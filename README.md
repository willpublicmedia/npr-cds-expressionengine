# NPR Content Distribution System

An ExpressionEngine addon for publishing to and from NPR's Content Distribution System (CDS).

Ported from Open Public Media's NPR CDS wordpress plugin.

## Description

The [NPR Content Distribution System (CDS)](https://npr.github.io/content-distribution-service/) Plugin provides push and pull functionality with the NPR CDS along with a user-friendly administrative interface.

NPR's CDS is a content API, which essentially provides a structured way for other computer applications to get NPR stories in a predictable, flexible and powerful way. The content that is available includes audio from most NPR programs dating back to 1995 as well as text, images and other web-only content from NPR and NPR member stations. This archive consists of over 250,000 stories that are grouped into more than 5,000 different aggregations.

This plugin also allows you to push your content to the NPR CDS, so that it can be republished by NPR or other NPR member stations.

Access to the NPR CDS requires a bearer token, provided by NPR. If you are an NPR member station or are working with an NPR member station and do not know your key, please [ask NPR station relations for help](https://studio.npr.org).

Usage of this plugin is governed by [NPR's Terms of Use](https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179876898/terms-of-use), and more specifically their [API Usage terms](https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179876898/terms-of-use#APIContent).

The WordPress plugin was originally developed as an Open Source plugin by NPR and is now supported by developers with NPR member stations working within the Open Public Media group. If you would like to suggest features or bug fixes, or better yet if you would like to contribute new features or bug fixes please visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenPublicMedia/npr-cds-wordpress) and post an issue or contribute a pull request.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can anyone get an NPR CDS Token?**

If you are an NPR member station or are working with an NPR member station and do not know your key, please [ask NPR station relations for help](https://studio.npr.org).

**Can anyone push content into the NPR CDS using this plugin?**

Push requires an Organization ID in the NPR CDS, which is typically given out to only NPR stations and approved content providers. If that's you, you probably already have an Organization ID.

**Where can I find NPR's documentation on the NPR CDS?**

There is documentation in the NPR's [Github site](https://npr.github.io/content-distribution-service/).
